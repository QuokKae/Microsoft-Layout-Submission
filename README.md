Here is my submission for the 3rd module. 

## Student comments

I had some trouble actually making a repo from scratch. I basically had to go onto GitHub and make a repo then. Afterwards, I uploaded my files and then just cloned the repo onto my machine.

I don't know if there's a way to actually just create a project from VSCode and then initiate a repo from there. I feel like there should be some kind of easier way of uploading a "repo" from my machine to GitHub, but I might be wrong haha.
